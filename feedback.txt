Check new line issue, it should allow new line charachter, but it's giving me error when adding multiple lines in the sample file

(((((hello (cap, 3))))))
(((((hello (cap,1))))))
hello (
  cap
)
heelo (cap) (up)

cap (cap) cap (cap) 

cap (cap, 0) cap (cap, cap)

cap (cap, 0) cap (cap, 0)



1: FIXED. just a dot "." so there is no word before any dot. 
2: Can not replicate this error. if there is a trailing vowel like "a" at the end of the sentence
3: FIXED. just a "'"
4: FIXED. (cap) alone. there is no words before cap
5: FIXED. (cap, 30) where only the first number is being taken (30 becomes 3 only)
6: FIXED. (cap, X) where X is more than the number of words before the operator
7: check ' multiple ' and a will give not correct result, or panic

((((((((((((((((((((((((((((hello) (cap))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
